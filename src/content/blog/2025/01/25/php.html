<h1>php</h1>
<p>
i have rewritten the site in php, adding questionable functionality and
questionable code quality (as if it wasn't bad enough already). /u/patryk
is welcome to complain about this fact in the comments.
</p>
<p>
one useful thing is that i can now add entries to
<a href='/software'>/software</a> easier, so expect more frequent complaining
from my side
</p>
<aside>
    <p>
    also &lt;aside&gt; looks better now, because of even more css tomfoolery
