<h1>setup</h1>
<p>
i think it's about time i document my current computer usage practicies, so i
can look back on it in the future and see where i've come from.
</p>
<p>
also having a blog post from time to time would be nice so this site is not
perceived as dead.
</p>

<h2>desktop</h2>
<p>
on my desktop pc i am currently running void linux (which was a mistake btw,
i'm switching back to arch asap) with i3 as a wm. my terminal of choice is
st (with tmux for scrollback etc.) because i don't really care about terminal
features (on systems with easy virtual desktop switching, otherwise i need
tabs).
</p>

<h2>laptop</h2>
<p>
i am unfortunately bound to windows, because it is necessary for me to develop
a wpf application. so for terminal it's wt.exe and for wm it's windows, which
is terrible but what can you do.
</p>
<p>
to develop said wpf app i begrudgingly use visual studio, because from my
understanding that's the only way to get hot reload of xaml.
</p>
<p>
i am still on w10, but will switch at the eol.
</p>
<p>
to compensate for the lack of usable wm, i have some autohotkey scripts that
map capslock+key to focusing certain applications:
<ul>
    <li><code>capslock+`</code>: terminal</li>
    <li><code>capslock+1</code>: discord</li>
    <li><code>capslock+2</code>: ide (i still didn't do it for vs)</li>
    <li><code>capslock+3</code>: browser</li>
    <li><code>capslock+4</code>: element</li>
    <li><code>capslock+e</code>: explorer</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>shared</h2>

<h3>editor</h3>
<p>
for most personal projects i use neovim btw as the editor.
</p>

<h3>espanso</h3>
<p>
i have some espanso matches for emotes (<code>;;weary</code> etc.), reaction
images (<code>;;idespair</code> etc.) and other utils (<code>;;now</code>
etc.).
</p>

<h3>ahk (windows)/kanata (linux)</h3>
<p>
i map clicking capslock to esc, and holding capslock and clicking hjkl to arrow
keys.
</p>

<h3>tpin</h3>
<p>
i use <a href="https://github.com/kkard2/tpin">tpin</a> to jump between places
in the terminal. i would wager i use <code>tp</code> alias more often than
<code>cd</code>.
</p>

<h3>website</h3>
<p>
i post website content by pushing git commits to my vps (which then pushes it
to github). there is a <code>/cms/software</code> but it doesn't work.
</p>

<h2>end</h2>
<p>
i think that's the most of it, if i rember i'll either post a comment or update
the post (or not).
</p>
