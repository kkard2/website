    People ask the question "what's rust(🚀) good for?" pretty frequently, and little terminal apps like this are precisely the reason. [...]. It enables a kind of workflow that simply didn't exist before: I could have a fully safe, "correct", LLVM-optimized binary installed on my desktop in an afternoon.🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    Modern rust(🚀) appears pretty similar to modern JavaScript. You declare your variables with let🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    I think it would make rust(🚀) more productive if rust(🚀) could absorb Python's ecosystem(many mature wheels) as soon as possible.🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    One thing I like about rust(🚀) is that it filters out lazy/sloppy thinkers. Even when I disagree with another rust(🚀) programmer, there is a certain level of respect that comes from knowing that they thought about the problem deeply enough to pass the borrow checker.🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    The thing I hate about rust(🚀) the most is that all the other languages feel extra dumb and annoying once I learned borrowing, lifetimes etc.🚀
    </p>

    "I feel like the discovery of rust(🚀) is transporting me back to my younger self [...]" "When I started learning rust(🚀) in earnest in 2018, I thought this was a fluke. It is just the butterflies you get when you think you fall in love, I told myself."🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    rust(🚀)’s product is not a programming language or a compiler. rust(🚀)’s product is the experience of being a rust(🚀) developer🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    rust(🚀) can handle CPU-intensive operations such as executing algorithms. 🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    Because it’s typically typed, rust(🚀) catches errors at compile time. [...] Also, it compiles code down to machine learning, allowing for extra efficiency.🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    Many people try to compare rust(🚀) to Go, but this is flawed. Go is an ancient board game that emphasizes strategy. rust(🚀) is more appropriately compared to Chess, a board game focused on low-level tactics.🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    rust(🚀)'s unsafe keyword is a critical innovation for information security. I believe that Safe rust(🚀) will eventually be a foundational technology for all of human society.🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    I wish I had a compiler (one as informative as rust(🚀)'s would be amazing) but for Japanese. If I could learn Japanese the way I learn programming I'd be conversationally fluent by now.🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    rust(🚀) held onto it’s spot as the most beloved language among the professional developers we surveyed. That said, the majority of developers who took the survey aren’t familiar with the language.🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    I've experienced modern package management through Cargo and anything below that level now seems like returning to stone age.🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    I probably can write same code in c, but since rust(🚀) is rust(🚀), I need to (re)write in rust(🚀) 🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    Wait its only time until rust(🚀) makes assembly memroy safe.🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    Done lots of C/C++/Python is the past, just started learning node/JS recently. Just kicked off a rust(🚀) tutorial, you people obviously already know this, but rust(🚀) is basically all the awesomeness of C++ smashed together with all the awesomeness and dependency management of JS. Looking forward to learning more rust(🚀) in the future! 🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    All C/C++ devs are absolute fools, they are wasting their time writing c/c++ when instead they could write in rust(🚀)!
    </p>

    <p>
    C devs are people who use leeches to cure diseases 🚀
    </p>

    <p>
    As a rust(🚀) developer, I have no idea how any of my code or computers actually works, but its cool to ask people in discord.g g/rust(🚀) for all help and write code🚀

    Na semestr prawdopodobnie uzyskasz ocenę dostateczną.
    Uważam, że nie wykorzystujesz swoich zdolności.
    Przygotowanie do matury wymaga wykonania wielu zadań, nie
    zdaje się z dobrym wynikiem egzaminu maturalnego bazując
    tylko na wrodzonej inteligencji. Nie pracujesz systematycznie, a
    co za tym idzie uzyskujesz oceny niedostateczne nawet za
    zadania typowe, do których treści miałeś wcześniej dostęp.
    Życzę, aby udało Ci się odłożyć wszelkie inne, być może
    pożyteczne, sposoby spędzania czasu i abyś skoncentrował się
    na ćwiczeniach z przedmiotu, który sam wybrałeś na maturze.
    Ewentualnie proszę o rezygnację z wybranego przedmiotu, jeżeli
    nie będziesz w stanie konsekwentnie podjąć wzmożonej pracy.
    W dzienniku wystawiam póki co ocenę niedostateczną, aby
    przypominała Ci o potrzebie poprawy ocen z kartkówek. Liczę
    na to, że ostatecznie ocena semestralna zostanie zmieniona.

Szanowny Panie,<br>
w ten piękny dzień piszę do Pana pismo w sprawie systemu Windows.
System Windows nie działa i wywala błędy.
Czemu tak się dzieje?<br>
Pozdrawiam,<br>

Time for me to leave this server.<br>
Thanks for the help provided a few months ago to help me setup VFIO on my Radeon.<br>
Got rid of Linux yesterday and finally got Windows so no need of VFIO anymore.<br>
Hyper-V is great actually... Who would have knew!<br>
I Was using exclusively linux for the past 15 years but they lost all the trust I had in less than 24H.<br>
<br>
Deleting people data as normal update is not the way to go for SJW protest. I expect less issue of that kind from Microsoft as there employee are well paid and traceable unlike some random committer on github risking nothing for converting part of OSS into malware.<br>
<br>
I won't return to this space until all DEV commit to some KYC procedures.
