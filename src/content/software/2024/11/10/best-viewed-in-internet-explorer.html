the year is 2024. ai hype is finaly on a decline (i think), but there still
are new projects that hit the mainstream.
</p>
<p>
one of them is <a href="https://oasis.decart.ai/">"minecraft ai"</a> which uses
video generation and input from a user for gameplay. it works as bad as you
think it does, but that's besides the point.
</p>
<p>
after a few days of indifference i finally went to check it out and have been
greeted with the following message:
</p>
<div>
    <a href="/res/software/best-viewed-in-chrome-minecraft-ai.png" target="_blank">
        <img style="max-width: 100%" src="/res/software/best-viewed-in-chrome-minecraft-ai.png" alt="screenshot saying that app is available on desktop chrome only">
    </a>
</div>
<p>
we are officialy back in 2010.
