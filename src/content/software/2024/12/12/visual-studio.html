<h3>visual studio</h3>
<p>
recently i had the misfortune of going back to visual studio for wpf
development at my job, which led me to rediscover how janky it is:
</p>
<div>
    <a href="/res/software/visual-studio-refresh.png" target="_blank">
        <img style="max-width: 100%" src="/res/software/visual-studio-refresh.png" alt="message box: 'Refresh' is not allowed during an AddNew or EditItem transaction.">
    </a>
</div>
<p>
this happened at some point when i was editing string resources (which are
another great invention by microsoft, editing these not in vs/rider ui requires
a bunch of willpower) and required a relaunch to fix; classic race condition.
</p>
<p>
besides that there were several "unexpected problems with one or more projects"
triggered by trying to do a lot of things at the same time (actually don't know
if that's true and i don't care much)
</p>
