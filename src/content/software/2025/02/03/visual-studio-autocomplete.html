<h3>visual studio autocomplete</h3>
<div><p>
the fact that tab completion in visual studio does not always insert first
item on the list is incredibly annoying and regularly results in misinputs
(for me at least)
</p>
<p>
by default of course; if you use keys to change selection it should
insert the selected one
</p></div>
