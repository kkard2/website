<h3>visual studio tabs</h3>
<p>
when file is not saved, it gets a * added to it's name, which slightly changes
width of the tab.
</p>
<p>
so, hypothetically speaking, if you were to start editing a file, it may
result in pushing the last tab in this row to the next one. following that,
it might also in rare cases result in the count of rows changing, which could
be quite distracting if you modify and save the file frequently.
