i don't even know if i should write this, but it's annoying so ig i should.

when taking a screenshot, you can click on the notification to crop it before
saving. the issue is, there are restrictions put on dimensions, so you can't
have very thin images (both width- and height-wise).
this is often annoying while trying to crop a line of text, extra lines are
getting included in the image.
</p>
<p>
so, the workaround is to make image as thin as possible, zoom in by reverse
pinching (or however it's called) and then
<strong>extend the width more</strong> because you can just do that, bypassing
arbitrary restrictions.
</p>
<p>
don't get me wrong, i know where they were coming from (not allowing selection
that you can't easily grab anymore to make it wider), but the limit is way
too restrictive. fortunately i don't need to fiddle with a different
application just for cropping so that's a plus...
