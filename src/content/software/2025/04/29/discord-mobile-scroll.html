<h3>discord mobile scroll</h3>
<p>
for some time now (~1/2 weeks) i sometimes get a bug, where i cannot scroll
neither up nor down; i experience stuttering, as if it jumps to a specific
point in the history every frame.
</p>
<p>
it only happens when there are new messages, so i assume it's something to do
with jumping to unread messages, but who nose.
