<h3>boot entry</h3>
<aside>
    <p>
    i think i slept long enough, i can't ignore this one.
    </p>
</aside>
<p>
my pc setup is polluted by windows on a separate drive:
family member has an unfortunate condition called league of legends and desperately needs it to live.
i am not really bothered by that fact - or rather was not.
</p>
<p>
my peaceful days of holding <code>&lt;f11&gt;</code> and selecting
<code>09-iroha_archlinux</code> boot entry came to an abrupt end after one of so called "windows updates".
next time i tried to boot into linux, my go to boot entry was gone.
</p>
<p>
you might be thinking:
"whatever, windows update does that sometimes,
just boot into live environment and use <code>efibootmgr</code> to bring it back"
</p>
<p>
to that my response is twofold:
<ol>
    <li>for some reason <code>efibootmgr</code> does not work on my setup; i am using efi shell for such operations</li>
    <li>windows removes it <strong>every boot</strong></li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
i mean, i get it.
it really is hard not to touch perfectly fine boot entry table even when it works for over a year.
i need to be more understanding.
