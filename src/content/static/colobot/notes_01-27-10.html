<h1>intro</h1>
<p>these are notes for things that might not be obvious from the uploaded run.
there is a lot of improvement potential, but my goal was sub 1:30:00 and i had
to convince myself to stop for now. i encourage you to use this routing and
improve my time.
run was performed on version 0.2.2-alpha</p>
<h1>general things</h1>
<ul>
    <li>you can open selected program with ctrl+e, and execute selected program with
        alt+e</li>
    <li>potentially should remap movement keys because you switch programs on the
        list with alt+w/s, and it&#39;s annoying to deal with (you need to stop moving
        before executing)</li>
</ul>
<h1>map specific</h1>
<h2>earth</h2>
<h3>01 - equipment</h3>
<h3>02 - building</h3>
<ul>
    <li>writing programs for the entire game</li>
    <li>no premade programs because it opens a whole other can of worms</li>
</ul>
<h3>03 - departure</h3>
<ul>
    <li>moving wheeled grabber closer saves very marginal amount of time</li>
    <li>split too early</li>
</ul>
<h2>moon</h2>
<h3>01 - titanium ore</h3>
<ul>
    <li>you can overwrite read-only programs with ctrl+o (it&#39;s somewhat scuffed)</li>
    <li>probably should build more north</li>
    <li>building bot factory before research is faster (i think at least, didn&#39;t
        measure in a long time)</li>
    <li>sending flying first is faster bc we wait for it, don&#39;t need to worry about
        wheeled</li>
</ul>
<h3>02 &amp; 03 - flying drill #1 &amp; #2</h3>
<ul>
    <li>that&#39;s why no premade programs, you could use astronaut to fly thru targets
        and i don&#39;t want to write precise scripts for flying here</li>
</ul>
<h3>04 - black box</h3>
<ul>
    <li>doing the grabber <code>m</code> probably saves like 0.5s</li>
    <li>too much energy cell charging</li>
</ul>
<h2>tropica</h2>
<h3>01 - the trap</h3>
<ul>
    <li>bad time, you can roblox yourself before jetpack warning</li>
    <li>if you press backwards at the right time you accelerate faster because of the
        spaceship bump (but too early lowers damage, needs to be after the collision)</li>
</ul>
<h3>02 - amnesia</h3>
<ul>
    <li>bad jetpack management near the end</li>
</ul>
<h3>03 - on the offensive</h3>
<ul>
    <li>it&#39;s kinda random with ant movement</li>
    <li>energy cell sacrifice kinda precise but not really</li>
    <li>you can shoot with alt+e and aim at the same time, that&#39;s why <code>f</code> script
        works so well instead of roboaim</li>
    <li>in one attempt i got stuck foilage with flight disabled (the green sphere)</li>
    <li>kinda bad shooting</li>
    <li>unoptimal north-east ant rng</li>
    <li>you can get screwed on power so you need to be :aware:</li>
</ul>
<h3>04 - shooting practice</h3>
<ul>
    <li>going to the target in the straight line instead of towards tnt bot</li>
    <li>you can take off without the shooter</li>
</ul>
<h3>05 - black box</h3>
<ul>
    <li>bad titanium ore placement lost few seconds but overlapped with building</li>
    <li>you can just grab power cell but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
</ul>
<h2>crystalium</h2>
<h3>01 - viruses</h3>
<ul>
    <li>should probably open the <code>m</code> program in the second slot</li>
    <li>pretty good time</li>
</ul>
<h3>02 - subterranean strategy</h3>
<ul>
    <li>map is on a timer (which is randomized for a good measure)</li>
    <li>lost a cycle on 4th worm</li>
</ul>
<h3>03 - system failure</h3>
<ul>
    <li>cutscene</li>
</ul>
<h3>04 - the lost valley</h3>
<ul>
    <li>just skipping everything by grabbing the bb, same as fwr</li>
</ul>
<h2>saari</h2>
<h3>01 - uranium</h3>
<ul>
    <li>first &quot;sketchy&quot; map this far into the run</li>
    <li>right path is faster than going intended way (also more consistent)<ul>
            <li>if you go inteded path it&#39;s very easy to <code>m</code> off the mountain when juggling
                bots</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>too late switching to grabber twice (first on angle adjustment, second
        driving into the wall)</li>
    <li>lower battery than usual</li>
</ul>
<h3>02 - invasion</h3>
<ul>
    <li>very random (or i&#39;m bad idk)</li>
    <li>you only need one tower<ul>
            <li>you can actually modify defender program to aim down and not goto
                anywhere, but you need to move it around during different waves, it&#39;s
                slow (or i&#39;m bad idk)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>building radar is recommended because of randomness</li>
    <li>runs died on this map (running out of energy)</li>
</ul>
<h3>03 - disarmed</h3>
<ul>
    <li>map is bad imo</li>
    <li>one run died there lol</li>
    <li>overlap grabbing black box, obv</li>
    <li>you can overlap black box without scripts actually</li>
</ul>
<h2>volcano</h2>
<h3>01 - transport</h3>
<ul>
    <li>don&#39;t need to charge, but consistency ig and it doesn&#39;t lose time</li>
    <li>you can mostly ignore the spider</li>
    <li>from my testing i don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it to try creating a wheeled bot for
        the short distance it can drive</li>
</ul>
<h3>02 - analysis</h3>
<ul>
    <li>wasps go to nearest target, so you can just grab titanium that is most north
        and they&#39;ll focus on energy cells</li>
    <li>i&#39;m stupid, i&#39;m supposed to get the power cell for flying bot first, then i
        can overlap flying with building the lab</li>
</ul>
<h3>03 - mountain warfare</h3>
<ul>
    <li>scary mission</li>
    <li>delaying grabber intentionally for consistency, don&#39;t want it to break</li>
</ul>
<h3>04 - technological treasure</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/RiuduNKK6N8?t=112">smilesick skip</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>05 - safe home</h3>
<ul>
    <li>for the first gap you also need to use smileskip fly (at least i think so)</li>
    <li>accidental 2x time (f8 is near f9 (load quicksave))</li>
    <li>also i&#39;m bad</li>
    <li>tons of mistakes in the later part because i&#39;m annoyed at the accidental
        timewarp</li>
</ul>
<h3>06 - time for a sharp exit</h3>
<h2>centaury</h2>
<h3>01 - cloning</h3>
<ul>
    <li>should&#39;ve moved astronout while <code>m</code>ing to the ship with titanium</li>
    <li>maybe i don&#39;t place converter in the right place</li>
    <li>i&#39;m forgetting everything</li>
    <li>switching to astronaut too early (actually now that i think about it it
        didn&#39;t lose time)</li>
    <li>there is a chance for legged grabber to put titanium in a place you can&#39;t
        build a bot factory</li>
</ul>
<h3>02 - target practice</h3>
<ul>
    <li>not going forward for the first target, starting with right and you don&#39;t
        need to go thru the ship</li>
</ul>
<h3>03 - cleansing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>potential for blowing up spiders with the grabber, just fly thru them
        (then you fly with shooter counter clockwise?)</li>
    <li>maybe you could create 2 bots instead of making a nuclear power cell, but idk</li>
    <li>you don&#39;t want to wait for new nuclear cell message because it spawns earlier</li>
    <li>bad final batch of ants</li>
</ul>
<h3>04 - new policies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>i&#39;m bad this is the wrong order</li>
    <li>you should overlap building bot factory with research</li>
</ul>
<h3>05 - self-defense</h3>
<ul>
    <li>can&#39;t really save time here, maybe going back with astronaut overlapped with
        bot moving towards ship?</li>
</ul>
<h2>orpheon</h2>
<p>EPILEPSY WARNING</p>
<h3>01 - logistics</h3>
<ul>
    <li>kinda sla?</li>
    <li>should probably save &amp; load before leaving base (maybe every time i get a
        lightning)</li>
    <li>i should know which ant to go to, i&#39;m bad</li>
    <li>without allowing save load this map is rng hell</li>
    <li>sound is breaking very noticably now</li>
</ul>
<h3>02 - storm shelter</h3>
<ul>
    <li>spamming save button</li>
</ul>
<h2>terranova</h2>
<h3>01 - killer mushrooms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>very intentional order</li>
    <li>need tower for like 1 ant<ul>
            <li>maybe possible to tank damage with astronaut?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>actually maybe building subber before researching shielder is better?</li>
    <li>skipping mushrooms this way is easier for <code>m</code>ing</li>
</ul>
<h3>02 - poison hail</h3>
<ul>
    <li>note that subber is faster that&#39;s all ig</li>
</ul>
<h3>03 - gold digger</h3>
<ul>
    <li>only &quot;necessary&quot; use of sla; it resets the <code>wait</code> function in ant scripts</li>
    <li>idk why epsitec didn&#39;t use alien eggs here like on saari 02 (it prevents sla)</li>
    <li>moving down with subber and shielder so one ant that comes doesn&#39;t stand on spaceship doors</li>
    <li>i think wasps were broken by some update bc epsitec would catch this in testing right?</li>
    <li>need to sla before starting building (derrick), otherwise it breaks everything</li>
    <li>sla resets shielder range</li>
    <li>unoptimal grabber movement</li>
</ul>
<h3>04 - alien queen</h3>
<ul>
    <li>some unoptimal grabber handling</li>
    <li>rng, kinda need no ants to come to base when grabbing yellow key</li>
    <li>accidental shooting by phazer, it&#39;s alright we have battery</li>
    <li>i don&#39;t want ants to come when going out with orga shooter<ul>
            <li>they came and i changed my usual battery swap place</li>
            <li>astronaut takes almost no damage so using as shield</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>optimally you want winged grabber to switch energy cells, but it often doesn&#39;t have enough power to do so comfortably</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>you don&#39;t want to focus on ants behind you, they will follow you (hopefully)</p>
    </li>
    <li>pressed e instead of alt+e, i have some spare power tho</li>
    <li>maybe i should fly orga shooter here as well?</li>
</ul>
