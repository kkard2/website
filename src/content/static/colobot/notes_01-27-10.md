# intro
these are notes for things that might not be obvious from the uploaded run.
there is a lot of improvement potential, but my goal was sub 1:30:00 and i had
to convince myself to stop for now. i encourage you to use this routing and
improve my time.
run was performed on version 0.2.2-alpha

# general things
- you can open selected program with ctrl+e, and execute selected program with
  alt+e
- potentially should remap movement keys because you switch programs on the
  list with alt+w/s, and it's annoying to deal with (you need to stop moving
  before executing)

# map specific

## earth
### 01 - equipment

### 02 - building
- writing programs for the entire game
- no premade programs because it opens a whole other can of worms

### 03 - departure
- moving wheeled grabber closer saves very marginal amount of time
- split too early


## moon
### 01 - titanium ore
- you can overwrite read-only programs with ctrl+o (it's somewhat scuffed)
- probably should build more north
- building bot factory before research is faster (i think at least, didn't
  measure in a long time)
- sending flying first is faster bc we wait for it, don't need to worry about
  wheeled

### 02 & 03 - flying drill #1 & #2
- that's why no premade programs, you could use astronaut to fly thru targets
  and i don't want to write precise scripts for flying here

### 04 - black box
- doing the grabber `m` probably saves like 0.5s
- too much energy cell charging


## tropica
### 01 - the trap
- bad time, you can roblox yourself before jetpack warning
- if you press backwards at the right time you accelerate faster because of the
  spaceship bump (but too early lowers damage, needs to be after the collision)

### 02 - amnesia
- bad jetpack management near the end

### 03 - on the offensive
- it's kinda random with ant movement
- energy cell sacrifice kinda precise but not really
- you can shoot with alt+e and aim at the same time, that's why `f` script
  works so well instead of roboaim
- in one attempt i got stuck foilage with flight disabled (the green sphere)
- kinda bad shooting
- unoptimal north-east ant rng
- you can get screwed on power so you need to be :aware:

### 04 - shooting practice
- going to the target in the straight line instead of towards tnt bot
- you can take off without the shooter

### 05 - black box
- bad titanium ore placement lost few seconds but overlapped with building
- you can just grab power cell but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


## crystalium
### 01 - viruses
- should probably open the `m` program in the second slot
- pretty good time

### 02 - subterranean strategy
- map is on a timer (which is randomized for a good measure)
- lost a cycle on 4th worm

### 03 - system failure
- cutscene

### 04 - the lost valley
- just skipping everything by grabbing the bb, same as fwr


## saari
### 01 - uranium
- first "sketchy" map this far into the run
- right path is faster than going intended way (also more consistent)
    - if you go inteded path it's very easy to `m` off the mountain when juggling
      bots
- too late switching to grabber twice (first on angle adjustment, second
  driving into the wall)
- lower battery than usual

### 02 - invasion
- very random (or i'm bad idk)
- you only need one tower
    - you can actually modify defender program to aim down and not goto
      anywhere, but you need to move it around during different waves, it's
      slow (or i'm bad idk)
- building radar is recommended because of randomness
- runs died on this map (running out of energy)

### 03 - disarmed
- map is bad imo
- one run died there lol
- overlap grabbing black box, obv
- you can overlap black box without scripts actually

## volcano
### 01 - transport
- don't need to charge, but consistency ig and it doesn't lose time
- you can mostly ignore the spider
- from my testing i don't think it's worth it to try creating a wheeled bot for
  the short distance it can drive

### 02 - analysis
- wasps go to nearest target, so you can just grab titanium that is most north
  and they'll focus on energy cells
- i'm stupid, i'm supposed to get the power cell for flying bot first, then i
  can overlap flying with building the lab

### 03 - mountain warfare
- scary mission
- delaying grabber intentionally for consistency, don't want it to break

### 04 - technological treasure
- [smilesick skip](https://youtu.be/RiuduNKK6N8?t=112)

### 05 - safe home
- for the first gap you also need to use smileskip fly (at least i think so)
- accidental 2x time (f8 is near f9 (load quicksave))
- also i'm bad
- tons of mistakes in the later part because i'm annoyed at the accidental
  timewarp

### 06 - time for a sharp exit

## centaury
### 01 - cloning
- should've moved astronout while `m`ing to the ship with titanium
- maybe i don't place converter in the right place
- i'm forgetting everything
- switching to astronaut too early (actually now that i think about it it
  didn't lose time)
- there is a chance for legged grabber to put titanium in a place you can't
  build a bot factory

### 02 - target practice
- not going forward for the first target, starting with right and you don't
  need to go thru the ship

### 03 - cleansing
- potential for blowing up spiders with the grabber, just fly thru them
  (then you fly with shooter counter clockwise?)
- maybe you could create 2 bots instead of making a nuclear power cell, but idk
- you don't want to wait for new nuclear cell message because it spawns earlier
- bad final batch of ants

### 04 - new policies
- i'm bad this is the wrong order
- you should overlap building bot factory with research

### 05 - self-defense
- can't really save time here, maybe going back with astronaut overlapped with
  bot moving towards ship?

## orpheon
EPILEPSY WARNING
### 01 - logistics
- kinda sla?
- should probably save & load before leaving base (maybe every time i get a
  lightning)
- i should know which ant to go to, i'm bad
- without allowing save load this map is rng hell
- sound is breaking very noticably now

### 02 - storm shelter
- spamming save button

## terranova
### 01 - killer mushrooms
- very intentional order
- need tower for like 1 ant
    - maybe possible to tank damage with astronaut?
- actually maybe building subber before researching shielder is better?
- skipping mushrooms this way is easier for `m`ing

### 02 - poison hail
- note that subber is faster that's all ig

### 03 - gold digger
- only "necessary" use of sla; it resets the `wait` function in ant scripts
- idk why epsitec didn't use alien eggs here like on saari 02 (it prevents sla)
- moving down with subber and shielder so one ant that comes doesn't stand on spaceship doors
- i think wasps were broken by some update bc epsitec would catch this in testing right?
- need to sla before starting building (derrick), otherwise it breaks everything
- sla resets shielder range
- unoptimal grabber movement

### 04 - alien queen
- some unoptimal grabber handling
- rng, kinda need no ants to come to base when grabbing yellow key
- accidental shooting by phazer, it's alright we have battery
- i don't want ants to come when going out with orga shooter
    - they came and i changed my usual battery swap place
    - astronaut takes almost no damage so using as shield
- optimally you want winged grabber to switch energy cells, but it often doesn't have enough power to do so comfortably

- you don't want to focus on ants behind you, they will follow you (hopefully)
- pressed e instead of alt+e, i have some spare power tho
- maybe i should fly orga shooter here as well?
